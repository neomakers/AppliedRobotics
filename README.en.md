   - Practical projects simulating real-world industrial scenarios.

4. **Path Planning & Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Algorithms for path planning and solving inverse kinematics problems.
   - Visualization of robot motions and task execution using Python's simulation tools.

5. **Innovations & Research**:
   - Exploration of advanced topics like AI integration, machine vision, and applications in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and service robotics.

### Getting Started

To get started with the repository, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/AI3DPrintCenter/AppliedRobotics.git
```

#### 2. Install required dependencies:
This project uses Python 3.7 or higher and several libraries for simulations. You can install the dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib sympy roboticstoolbox-python
```

#### 3. Running the Simulations:
Navigate to the specific experiment folder and run the Python scripts. For example, to run the SCARA robot simulation:
